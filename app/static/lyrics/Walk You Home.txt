สุรสีห์ อิทธิกุล
Tonight
It's just the two of us
So forget the world for a while
Open your heart and open your eyes
I'm right here in front of you
And you look so pretty in your dress
Though I know I look like a mess
I'll do my best
to win your heart
So can I walk you home tonight?
Please tell me how you feel
cause deep inside I know it's real
I promise I will forever be yours
Darling open up to me let me walk you home
Before it's morning
Before the sunrise
Before I go back to reality
And you go back to your life
Tell me that you feel the same way too
Please tell me how you feel
cause deep inside I know it's real
I promise I will forever be yours
Darling open up to me let me walk you home
Even if you'll never be mine
I'm in love with you tonight
